		<br>Hello! 
		<br>
		<br>I'm currently the <b>Collections and Partnerships Coordinator</b> at the Center for Research Libraries, 
			and an <b>Associate Lecturer</b> at the iSchool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
			In the past, I've worked for the <b>Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation</b>
			and <b>StoryCorps</b>.
		<br>
		<br>I've been a web archivist for five years, and have deep experience in building and sustaining collaborative partnerships. 
		I'm interested in collaborative collecting, especially of born-digital material, and the ways in which
		the field can leverage its collective assets and expertise to build meaningful collections and relationships across
		multiple communities.
		<br>
		<br>I recently co-authored <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjM3PuP797xAhWqKVkFHemyAusQFnoECA0QAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademiccommons.columbia.edu%2Fdoi%2F10.7916%2Fd8-c7kw-1512%2Fdownload&usg=AOvVaw2HKKS4_W6jBvr-QNS9HP82">Sowing the Seeds for More Usable Web Archives: A Usability Study of Archive-It</a>, which was published in the American Archivist.
