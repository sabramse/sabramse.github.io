		<br>
		<br>Hello! 
		<br>
		<br>I'm currently the <b>Collections and Partnerships Coordinator</b> at the Center for Research Libraries, 
			and an <b>Associate Lecturer</b> at the iSchool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
			In the past, I've worked for the <b>Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation</b>
			and <b>StoryCorps</b>.
		<br>
		<br>I've been a web archivist for five years, and have deep experience in building and sustaining collaborative partnerships. 
		I'm interested in collaborative collecting, especially of born-digital material, and the ways in which
		the field can leverage its collective expertise to build meaningful relationships across
		multiple communities.
		<br>
		<br>Here's a copy of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MC0eXRHc77pCSeMe4FHCq3oJre1cVyVT/view?usp=sharing">curriculum vitae</a>, and more information about the 
		<a href="https://ischool.wisc.edu/continuing-education/web-archiving">Continuing Education course</a> I teach.
		<br>
		<br> I'm on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/smbrms">@smbrms</a>, and can be reached at sabrams at crl dot edu.
