		<br>
		<br>Hello! 
		<br>
		<br>I'm currently the <b>Collections and Partnerships Coordinator</b> at the 
			<a href="https://www.crl.edu">Center for Research Libraries</a>, 
			and an <b>Associate Lecturer</b> at the iSchool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
			In the past, I've worked for the <a href="https://ivpluslibraries.org">Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation</a>
		and <a href="https://storycorps.org">StoryCorps</a>.
		<br>
		<br>I've been a web archivist for five years, and have deep experience in building and sustaining collaborative partnerships. 
		I'm interested in collaborative collecting, especially of born-digital material, and the ways in which
		the field can leverage its collective expertise to build meaningful partnerships that span multiple communities and disciplines.
		<br>
		<br>Here's a copy of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MC0eXRHc77pCSeMe4FHCq3oJre1cVyVT/view?usp=sharing">curriculum vitae</a>. 
		I'm on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/smbrms">@smbrms</a>, <br>and can be reached at sabrams at crl dot edu.
