		<br>Hello! 
		<br>
		<br>I'm currently a <b>Knowledge Management Specialist</b> at the 
			<a href="https://www.justworks.com/">Justworks</a>, 
			and an <b>Associate Lecturer</b> at the iSchool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
		In the past, I've worked for the <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a>, the <a href="https://ivpluslibraries.org">Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation</a>,
		and <a href="https://storycorps.org">StoryCorps</a>.
		<br>
		<br>I am an information professional with experience coordinating complex, multi-institutional
		partnerships, both nationally and internationally. I have a long history of developing collections, partnerships,
		and community engagement policies and strategies that support expanded forms of scholarly engagement and
		research. I'm a frequent teacher and workshop facilitator with the ability to translate complicated, technical
		concepts to a wide range of audiences. I have experience with project management, long-term planning,
		and change management, and am deeply committed to creative thinking and problem solving through collaboration.
		<br>
		<br>Here's a copy of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P05XbNACWJQi2ffu2RkyRBsMOhXGNqb0/view?usp=sharing">curriculum vitae</a>. I'm on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/smbrms">@smbrms</a>, and can be reached at sabramse at gmail dot com.
